/**
 * The base action class that describes an operation to perform.
 * <p>
 * An action is an abstraction over a unary function, which takes
 * {@link com.urbanairship.actions.ActionArguments} and performs a defined task,
 * producing an optional {@link com.urbanairship.actions.ActionResult}. Actions
 * may restrict or vary the work they perform depending on the arguments they
 * receive, which may include type introspection and runtime context.
 * <p>
 * In the larger view, the Actions framework provides a convenient way to
 * automatically perform tasks by name in response to push notifications,
 * Rich App Page interactions and JavaScript.
 * <p>
 * The UA library comes with pre-made actions for common tasks such as setting
 * tags and opening URLs out of the box, but this class can also be extended to
 * enable custom app behaviors and engagement experiences.
 * <p>
 * While actions can be run manually, typically they are associated with names
 * in the {@link com.urbanairship.actions.ActionRegistry}, and run
 * on their own threads with the {@link com.urbanairship.actions.ActionRunRequest}.
 * <p>
 * Actions that are either long lived or are unable to be interrupted by the device
 * going to sleep should request a wake lock before performing. This is especially
 * important for actions that are performing in SITUATION_PUSH_RECEIVED, when a
 * push is delivered when the device is not active.
 * <p>
 * The value returned by {@link #shouldRunOnMainThread()} determines which thread should
 * run the action if executed asynchronously. If an action involves a UI interaction, this
 * method should be overridden to return true so that the action definitely runs before the
 * app state changes.
